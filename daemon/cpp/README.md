Besides the paho mqtt client (http://git.eclipse.org/c/paho/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.c.git/), getoptpp (https://code.google.com/p/getoptpp/), the header-only log library from http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/logging-in-c/201804215 and libserial (http://libserial.sourceforge.net/) which are included in this repository, this project depends on sqlite3 (http://www.sqlite.org/capi3ref.html) and openssl (https://www.openssl.org/) which must be installed properly on the system.
